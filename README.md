Since Mr Keprins runs off a single Python script, he needs soemwhere to store all his data! This is it! There are multiple files which all contain important information for Mr Keprins to function.



`bad words.txt` is where all the swear words and bad stuff are stored, so Mr Keprins can make sure no one uses him for bad pruposes. By storing the file on Github, selected people can use Mr Keprins to add to that list whenever they want.

`channels.txt` is an old file. It was used for a few weeks to try and see which channels were the most active, but that function was removed. The file serves no purpose now.

`covid.txt` is a file where covid data for Western Australia is stored. It is used for the `kp covid` function in Mr Keprins.

`events.txt` is the file where every upcoming event is recorded. 

`logs.txt` is where it was attempted to log everything which happens on Mr Keprins, however it is no longer in use.

`points.txt` is the most important file. It stores a record of every user which Mr Keprins has seen send a message, and for each user, it records points, last gn, last gm, daily streak, last daily, meme points, trivia points, and xp.

`servers.txt` is where Mr Keprins stores a record of every server he is in, for use with the `kp server list` command. More importantly, this file also records each messge sent in that server, and the time since records began. This is to get the message rate with the `kp server rate` command.

This is a public repository, and anyone is welcome to look around and see what's going on. Why don't you add Mr Keprins to you discord server?
